# Carbon
Carbon is a custom, free-to-use theme for [reddit.com](http://reddit.com). You can see a live preview of the theme at [/r/Carbon](http://reddit.com/r/carbon).

`Current release: v1.0`

## About

Carbon is a "dark" theme, similar to [RES](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) nightmode, and is an option in the new [reddit themes](http://www.reddit.com/r/goldbenefits/comments/33ei8y/introducing_reddit_themes_change_the_appearance/) feature. The theme can also be used to style personal subreddits. See the [installation](#installation) details below for more information.

The theme is still **in development**. The following are on the to-do list:

* RES compatibility
* RES nightmode compatibility
* Cross browser discrepancies
* reddit Toolbox compatibility
